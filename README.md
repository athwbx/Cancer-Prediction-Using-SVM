## Cancer Prediction Using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This repository explores the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict cancer outcomes based on medical data. The goal of this project is to apply a robust machine learning model to classify patients based on their likelihood of having cancer, using key features in the dataset.

### Project Goals

- Analyze a dataset containing cancer-related medical features.
- Build and train a Support Vector Machine model for cancer prediction.
- Evaluate the model's performance using relevant classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Technologies Used

- Python (libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification tasks
- Data visualization for exploratory analysis

### Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand the relationships between features using scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarize the data using mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant statistical measures.

### Model Building

- **Model Training:** Train an SVM model on the prepared dataset, using cancer-related features.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's classification performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Results

The results provide insights into the effectiveness of the SVM model for cancer prediction. Metrics like precision and recall highlight the model's ability to balance between identifying true positives and avoiding false positives. While the SVM model offers good predictive performance, further refinement through feature selection or hyperparameter tuning may improve the results.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SVM can be effectively applied to cancer prediction tasks, offering a strong classification model for medical applications. Although the current model performs well, there is still potential for improvement through feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, or exploring more advanced machine learning techniques.

### Future Work

- **Feature Engineering:** Identify and incorporate additional features that may better explain the variance in cancer outcomes.
- **Model Complexity:** Experiment with other classification models such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune SVM hyperparameters for optimized performance.
- **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to ensure a more reliable estimate of model performance.
